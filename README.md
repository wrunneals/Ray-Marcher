# Ray Marcher
 A "simple" ray marcher written in Java. Working towards an engine that will be able to render fractals in 3D in high definition for ... science? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Notable progress:
 - Created a working version that can render simple shapes (spheres) with shadows.
 - Created a working DE for the Madelbox and successfully rendered a very flat looking image.
 - Added Blinn-Phong shading for better looking images

## History/Images
### Earliest version

### A working Mandelbox DE
First (very flat) Mandelbox rendering.

After adding in a Blinn-Phong shading model images are starting to look better.
